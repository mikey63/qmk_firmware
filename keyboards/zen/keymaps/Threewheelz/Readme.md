- 3 Layers
- Changes Enter key to dual-role tap action: Hold=Right Shift, Tap=Enter
- Caps/Nav becomes Caps/Cntrl: Hold=LCntrl, Tap=Caps Lock
- Right Spacebar acts as a Fn(Nav) key when held, switches to Layer 1.
- Layer0 = default querty layer
- Layer1 = Function keys F1-F5, RGB Control on Left hand
		 = Numpad starting on the 7-8-9 columns, and volume controls on the + and - keys.
- Layer2 = same as Layer1 on left, Function keys F6-F12 and IJKL navigation on right.
- see keymap.c file in notepad for more info

To change tap duration (default is 100ms), go to last line in config.h file located in the keyboards/zen directory (not the one in this folder!).

Use same left and right hand .eep files from Let's Split.
